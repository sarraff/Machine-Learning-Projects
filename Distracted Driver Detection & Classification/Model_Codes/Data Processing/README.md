## Data Processing 

### 1. Sobel Data Processing
Sobel Data processing uses sobel operator. The Sobel operator, sometimes called the Sobelâ€“Feldman operator or Sobel filter, is used in image processing and computer vision, particularly within edge detection algorithms where it creates an image emphasising edges.

`Sobel_Data_Processing.py` will convert Image -> Sobel Image -> Edge-emphasized flattened vectors

### 2. RGB Data Processing
RGB Data Processing will convert each pixel into a 1*3 matrix repersenting RGB value of a pixel.

`RGB_Data_Processing.py` will convert Image -> RGB Image Vector -> flattened vectors
