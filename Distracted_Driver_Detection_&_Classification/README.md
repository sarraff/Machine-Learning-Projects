# Detecting-Distracted-Driver-&-Classification App

The goal of the app is to label whether the car driver is driving safe or performing any activity that might result in a accident or any harm to others. Since the project is based on multi-class classification problem, with a total of 10 classes including a class of ‘safe driving’, the app will also label the car driver class among the given 10 classes. The image below gives the 10 classes:
